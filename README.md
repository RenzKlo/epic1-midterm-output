# mandala-pattern

Daria-Kent-Lorenz-V

The mandala pattern is generated by creating certain shapes 
and then repeating it to form a radial pattern. Shapes are created by using 
different techniques, often using only forward command of the turtle,
using for statements to draw shapes in  circle pattern,
changing angles while moving, and using circle shape function 
to create a leaf like shape. The design was entirley made with radial pattern.
Codes used were based form the Turtle Graphics python documentation.
